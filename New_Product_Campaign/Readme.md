## New Product Campaign Competition Webpage

### Scenario :
<hr>
A client approached us to create a social media campaign for the launch of their new talcum powder. Let’s call the drink “Honeymint”. The client also advised they are on a limited budget. The creatives met up with the client and came up with an idea. The idea is to build a simple competition webpage within the client’s website that encourages people to spread the news about the new product. Users arrive at the page and sign up a form. After a successful sign up, they get one entry for the competition. At that point, they also have an option to share the sign up link. Every successful sign up referred via the link will give extra competition entries to the original link poster. There is no limit to the number of entries that a person can have. So the idea is: The more entries you have, the higher your chance to win the prize. The prize is 100 bottles of Honeymint. The top 10 persons with the most entries will win the prize.
